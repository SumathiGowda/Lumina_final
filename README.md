# Lumina â€“ College Club Website (Backend)

**Lumina** is a college club web application built to help students share updates, events, and activities through a social media-style platform. I worked on this as the **backend developer**, focusing on building all the core server-side functionality.

This was part of a college-level project to get hands-on experience with backend development, working with databases, and implementing real-world features like user roles, authentication, and content moderation.

## ðŸ”§ What we Built

-  User Sign-Up and Sign-In with authentication
-  Role-based access (Admins vs. regular users)
-  Post creation system where users can share updates
-  Admin panel to approve or reject user posts
-  MySQL database integration for storing users, posts, and roles


## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Authentication**: Sessions or JWT (mention which one you used)  
- **Others**: bcrypt for password hashing


## What we Learned

Working on Lumina gave me practical experience in:
- Writing REST APIs with Node and Express
- Handling secure user login and registration flows
- Implementing role-based access control (admin vs. regular users)
- Managing CRUD operations with MySQL
- Building scalable, maintainable backend code for real-world use cases

## About the Project

This project was built to gain practical, hands-on experience in backend web development using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It implements key features like user authentication, role-based access control, post creation and moderation, and file uploads within a club website context.

While it's currently designed for learning and demonstration purposes, with a few improvements (like enhanced security, better UI/UX, and deployment readiness), this system has the potential to be adapted for **real-world use in college clubs or community platforms**.
